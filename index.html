        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I’m Kai, a freshman at the University of Pittsburgh, pursuing a double major in Data Science and Economics. I’m passionate about motorsports, photography, and tech. After living in Japan for six years, I discovered my love for cars—currently working on my e210 hatchback 6mt. When I’m not behind the wheel, I’m tinkering with Arch Linux on old ThinkPads, weightlifting, or diving into a good book. I’m a big fan of Formula One, soccer, and football, and I enjoy the endless pursuit of self-improvement through learning and digital minimalism.</p>

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p><p>
        <h3>Panther Racing (2024-Present)</h3>
        <h4>Live Telemetry Team Member</h4>
        <p>I help to Facilitate real-time access to telemetry data from the Swanson School of Engineering's Panther Racing Formula SAE car by managing a multi-script server system for seamless data flow. The system receives raw sensor data, translates it via CAN protocols, and routes the processed data to a live dashboard for subteam analysis during competitions and R&D. By using asynchronous queues and custom Python functions, the system efficiently handles large data volumes, prevents latency, and restarts smoothly when the car reboots, ensuring reliable, low-latency telemetry access.</p>

        <h3>The Pitt News (2024-Present)</h3>
        <h4>Photographer</h4>
        <p>I capture dynamic, high-quality visuals for digital and print platforms, including campus events, sports, and breaking news. Collaborate with editorial teams at TPN to create content that complements storytelling. In addition to this, I’ve covered high-profile events such as U.S. presidential visits and weddings, with notable work photographing President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo. My work has earned recognition in both the U.S. and Japan, generating significant revenue.</p>
