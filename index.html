        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I’m Kai, a freshman at the University of Pittsburgh, pursuing a double major in Data Science and Economics. I’m passionate about motorsports, photography, and tech. After living in Japan for six years, I discovered my love for cars—currently working on my e210 hatchback 6mt. When I’m not behind the wheel, I’m tinkering with Arch Linux on old ThinkPads, weightlifting, or diving into a good book. I’m a big fan of Formula One, soccer, and football, and I enjoy the endless pursuit of self-improvement through learning and digital minimalism.</p>

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p><p>
        <h3>Panther Racing (2024-Present)</h3>
        <h4>Live Telemetry Team Member</h4>
        <p>I help to Facilitate real-time access to telemetry data from the Swanson School of Engineering's Panther Racing Formula SAE car by managing a multi-script server system for seamless data flow. The system receives raw sensor data, translates it via CAN protocols, and routes the processed data to a live dashboard for subteam analysis during competitions and R&D. By using asynchronous queues and custom Python functions, the system efficiently handles large data volumes, prevents latency, and restarts smoothly when the car reboots, ensuring reliable, low-latency telemetry access.</p>
        <p><p>
        <h3>AI & Robotics Startup (NDA Restricted)</h3>
        <h4>AI Robotics Operator</h4>
        <p>I Operate robotic systems to execute assigned tasks accurately and efficiently, supporting the development of machine learning models. Follow detailed instructions and consistently meet performance targets in a fast-paced, results-driven environment. Troubleshoot and report system issues to engineering teams, ensuring optimal robot functionality. Maintain high standards of operational safety and efficiency while working with cutting-edge robotic technologies.</p>
