                    <h3><a href="https://p1yte.github.io/website/">Old Website</a></h3>
                    <p>This was my very first website, designed entirely in HTML and inspired by the aesthetics of jvscholz's website. It primarily served as my photography portfolio and was quite simple in design. Building it was a great learning experience as I became familiar with using GitHub Pages to host the site. The process helped me better understand the basics of web development and hosting, and it marked a key step in my journey as a creator.

                    <h3><a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/6Nf579g7-Lk?feature=share">Madden Football Deffensive Analysis App</a></h3>
                    <p>I created this app in early 2024, driven by my love for football and Madden. The goal was to improve my in-game performance by building a tool that could help me analyze defensive plays. The app uses a decision tree algorithm that asks users a series of questions to identify the type of defensive formation. Once identified, it suggests offensive plays that exploit the defense's weaknesses. This project was my first experience using Swift (and possibly my last, haha), and it was a great opportunity to dive into app development while merging my passion for football strategy.</p>
