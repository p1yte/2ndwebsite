        <h2>Books</h2>
        <p>Here are some of the books I’ve read and recommend, covering various topics like studying, self-improvement, novels, and more.</p>
        
        <div class="book-list">
            <!-- Book 1 -->
            <div class="book-item">
                <img src="assets/stoner.png" alt="Book 1 Cover" class="book-cover">
                <div class="book-info">
                    <h3>Stoner</h3>
                    <p><strong>Author:</strong> John Williams</p>
                    <p>Stoner by John Williams was one of the first novels I ever read, and it is still my favorite. The writing is absolutely beautiful, drawing me into a peaceful, almost familiar setting. I was captivated by the complex character dynamics, especially the exploration of relationship abuse through the stoic lens of Stoner. His quiet discovery of love, both for literature and in his personal relationships, was deeply inspiring to me. The tender relationship with his daughter moved me, and this book played a huge role in making me fall in love with fiction.</p>

            <!-- Book 2 -->
            <div class="book-item">
                <img src="assets/goggins.jpg" alt="Book 2 Cover" class="book-cover">
                <div class="book-info">
                    <h3>Can't Hurt Me</h3>
                    <p><strong>Author:</strong> David Goggins</p>
                    <p>I went into Can't Hurt Me thinking David Goggins was invincible, capable of achieving anything through sheer willpower. But what struck me most was realizing how human he is—once overweight, lost, and struggling. His journey to mastering his mind and developing "mental calluses" was truly inspiring. I was surprised to learn it took him multiple tries to break the pull-up record and complete SEAL training, proving persistence is everything. Goggins' constant question, “Can I take one more step?” sticks with me because the answer is always yes.</p>

            <!-- Book 3 -->
            <div class="book-item">
                <img src="assets/numbers.png" alt="Book 2 Cover" class="book-cover">
                <div class="book-info">
                    <h3>A Mind for Numbers</h3>
                    <p><strong>Author:</strong> Barbara Oakley</p>
                    <p>I really enjoyed A Mind for Numbers by Barbara Oakley. Growing up with little confidence in math, this book opened my eyes to different thinking strategies—focused and diffused modes—and the importance of the German concept of Einstellung (insight-based problem solving). The clear examples made complex ideas easy to understand. I think it’s a must-read for any student studying math or science, as it not only boosts comprehension but also builds confidence in learning these subjects.</p>

            <!-- Book 4 -->
            <div class="book-item">
                <img src="assets/phm.jpg" alt="Book 2 Cover" class="book-cover">
                <div class="book-info">
                    <h3>Project Hail Mary</h3>
                    <p><strong>Author:</strong> Andy Weir</p>
                    <p>Project Hail Mary was my first science fiction book, and I was completely surprised by how immersed I became in the story. Andy Weir did an incredible job making it feel like a movie I was watching. Every time I stopped reading, I couldn't wait to start again. The characters were fantastic, and the entire book was a rollercoaster ride. The story made me realize how much I still have to learn about the natural world—especially in physics and chemistry. It also deepened my appreciation for mathematics as the language of our universe and left me with a sense of moral responsibility to better understand it.</p>

              <!-- Book 5 -->
              <div class="book-item">
                <img src="assets/deepwork.jpg" alt="Book 2 Cover" class="book-cover">
                <div class="book-info">
                    <h3>Deep Work</h3>
                    <p><strong>Author:</strong> Cal Newport</p>
                    <p>Deep Work is an incredibly relevant book in today’s ultra-digital world. Thanks to this book and Newport’s other work, Digital Minimalism, I haven’t had social media on my phone for over three years and have drastically reduced my phone use. Newport's focus on intentional living and regaining control of our time truly changed my approach to work. Many, including myself, have wasted hours in the library—distracted by phones and websites, which often serve as mental pacifiers when we are uncomfortable. Newport’s philosophy transformed how I work, helping me focus deeply and become more productive. I highly recommend it to all students and knowledge workers.</p>

                <div class="book-info">
                    <h3>East of Eden</h3>
                    <p><strong>Author:</strong> John Steinback</p>
                    <p>I was captivated by East of Eden, particularly the complex relationships between Charles and Adam Trask and Cal and Aron. Steinbeck's decision to link their struggles to the biblical story of Cain and Abel added so much depth, illustrating the timeless conflict between good and evil. Especially Cal's realization that he can reject the darker sides of himself, was incredibly thought-provoking. However, it’s not just about rejection—Cal learns to observe and understand these darker impulses, realizing they don’t define him. The generational patterns, the weight of inherited guilt, and the longing for acceptance all made this novel a rich exploration of human nature. East of Eden wasn’t just a story; it felt like a meditation on family, identity, and the eternal struggle between light and darkness within us all.</p>
